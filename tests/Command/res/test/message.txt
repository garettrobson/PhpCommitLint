feat(user-auth): Add multi-factor authentication

This commit introduces multi-factor authentication for user accounts.
The new feature allows users to enable 2FA using either SMS or
authenticator apps.

Key changes:
- Added new database table for storing 2FA settings
- Implemented SMS verification flow
- Added support for TOTP-based authenticator apps
- Updated user settings UI to include 2FA options

Breaking changes:
The user login API now returns a new field \'requires_2fa\'
which must be handled by clients.
